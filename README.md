# Automatic hit reporting tool for FINNGEN

## A tool for finding gws results from GWAS summary statistics

This pipeline is used to
1) Filter out and group gws SNPs from FINNGEN summary statistics
2) Perform finemapping on the filtered SNPs
3) Annotate the SNPs using gnoMAD and FINNGEN annotations
4) Cross-reference the SNPs to previous results, e.g. online databases and/or hand-picked results from studies
